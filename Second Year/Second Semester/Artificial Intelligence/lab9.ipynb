In this variation, we introduce weights to the queens and aim to find a placement that maximizes the total weight of the queens while satisfying the constraint of non-threatening positions.\n",

        "\n",
        "5. *Mutation*: Introduce random changes (mutations) in the offspring permutations to maintain diversity in the population.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. *Fitness Evaluation for the new individuals*: Evaluate the fitness of the new population.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. *Form the new population*: Select the surviving individuals based on scores, with chances direct proportional with their performance.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "9. *Termination*: Return the best-performing individual (permutation) found as the solution to the problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "Note: The fitness function used in this problem should calculate the total weight of the queens based on the positions specified by the permutation. Additionally, the fitness function should penalize solutions that violate the non-threatening constraint by assigning a lower fitness score to such permutations."
