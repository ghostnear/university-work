# Task 8

Write recursive Lisp functions for the following problems:

a) Write a function to return the difference of two sets.

b) Write a function to reverse a list with its all sublists, on all levels.

c) Write a function to return the list of the first elements of all list elements of a given list with an odd number of elements at superficial level.
Example: (1 2 (3 (4 5) (6 7)) 8 (9 10 11)) => (1 3 9).

d) Write a function to return the sum of all numerical atoms in a list at superficial level.
