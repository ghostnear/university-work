# Lab 7

Implement:

1. Algorithms corresponding to parsing table (if needed) and parsing strategy

2. Class ParserOutput - DS and operations corresponding to a table (using father and sibling relation) (required operations: transform parsing tree into representation; print DS to screen and to file)

Remark: If the table contains conflicts, you will be helped to solve them. It is important to print a message containing row (state) and column (symbol) where the conflict appears.
