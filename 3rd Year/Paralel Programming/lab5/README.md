# Lab 5 - Parallelizing techniques

The goal of this lab is to implement a simple but non-trivial parallel algorithm.

## Requirement

Perform the multiplication of 2 polynomials. Use both the regular O(n^2) algorithm and the Karatsuba algorithm, and each in both the sequencial form and a parallelized form. Compare the 4 variants.

Bonus: do the same for big numbers.
