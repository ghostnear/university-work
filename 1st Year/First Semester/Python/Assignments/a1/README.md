# :computer: Assignment 01

## Requirements
- Solve one problem statement from each set
- Write the solution to each problem statement in its corresponding Python module (`p1.py`, `p2.py` and `p3.py` respectively).
- Use functions, input parameters and return values
- Each function only does one thing!
- Do not use global variables
- Provide the user relevant messages regarding expected input and the meaning of the programâ€™s output.
- Assignment should be **completed by week 2, hard deadline is week 3**.

## Problem Statements
### First Set
5. Generate the largest prime number smaller than a given natural number `n`. If such a number does not exist, a message should be displayed.

### Second Set
10. The palindrome of a number is the number obtained by reversing the order of its digits (e.g. the `palindrome of 237 is 732`). For a given natural number `n`, determine its palindrome.

### Third Set
15. Generate the largest perfect number smaller than a given natural number `n`. If such a number does not exist, a message should be displayed. A number is perfect if it is equal to the sum of its divisors, except itself. (e.g.  `6 is a perfect number, as 6=1+2+3`).
