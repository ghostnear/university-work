# Lab 1

Implement 3 different algorithms for computing the greatest common divisor of 2 natural numbers.

One of the algorithms should work for numbers of arbitrary size!

Perform a comparative running-time analysis of these algorithms for a set of at least 10 inputs (use appropriate time units in order to differentiate the algorithms).

## Points
- 0.5 points if handed in by Week 4.
- 0.25 points if handed in by Week 6.
