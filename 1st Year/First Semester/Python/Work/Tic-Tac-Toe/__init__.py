        Tic Tac Toe
- HUMAN vs. COMPUTER SHOWDOWN -

1. Modular Programming.
    UI (all input / printing here)
    Game (aka. function modules, computer player)
    Board (everything that has to do with the board nad its representation)

2. Test Driven Development.
    1. Write the specification of the target function.
    2. Write a test function based on the specification.
    3. Write the test function ==> IT MUST FAIL!
    4. Implement the target function until the test passes :)
    5. Optional: optimize the target function
    6. Profit !?

3. Exceptions.

4. Command-driven UI.
    move x, y
    ragequit
    takeback
